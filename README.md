standby-lb-detector
=====

Tired of making changes to the standby Big-IP by mistake? This extension detects when you log into a standby Big-IP and notifies you by making the page grey and ugly. Can of course be temporary disabled, if you are in fact going to make changes to the standby node.

Inspired by the extension "Ugly HTTP" by lgarron.
